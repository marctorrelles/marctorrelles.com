Ever struggled to find a simple and free Pomodoro app on the App Store? So did I!
That's why I decided to learn Swift and create an app just with that in mind.
Flexo is beautiful, minimalistic and absolutely free.

You can download it [for free on the App
Store](https://apps.apple.com/app/flexo-focus-pomodoro-timer/id6469589285) now.
