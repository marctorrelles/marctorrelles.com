Have you ever felt the itch for change, the desire of something new and shining, even when you're
comfortably settled in a familiar routine? For the past decade, I've been immersed in the world of
coding, a journey that began in my university days with humble C code and led me to my current role
as a Staff Engineer at [Factorial](https://factorialhr.com). While this path has provided financial
security and professional growth, a sense of restlessness has crept in recently, compelling me to
embark on a new, more exhilarating adventuree.

# The comfort zone

Coding has been my bread and butter for the past years. I started as a junior developer in a small
company, and over time, I've steadily climbed the ranks, acquiring not only technical skills but
also invaluable insights into phenomena like impostor syndrome and the fear of deploying new code.
Yet, this journey has been more than just mastering the intricacies of programming. It's been about
growth, mentorship, and the bonds forged through collaboration.

As I reflect on my path, I've come to realize that the true magic of this world lies not only in the
lines of code but also in the camaraderie and collective problem-solving with my colleagues. It's in
the infinite pairing sessions and the shared victories and setbacks that I've grown to cherish. In
the context of my comfort zone, it's not just about the familiarity of coding; it's about the
profound connections and collaborative spirit that have defined my journey.

Leaving a job that you've poured time and energy into is never a decision to be taken lightly. It's
like stepping into the unknown, uncertain about where your next opportunity will lead you. But
sometimes, that leap of faith is precisely what's needed to reignite the dormant passion within.

# Vertigo

Vertigo â€“ that's precisely what I experienced the moment I made the decision to leave my job and
embark on a new adventure. What lies ahead? Will I stumble upon a passion that ignites my soul, or
will I find myself back in the familiar embrace of comfort? Asking these questions sends me into a
whirlwind of emotions, a state I'm not accustomed to. I usually prefer to play it safe, satisfying
my controlling, rational mind almost all the time.

Yet, I also recognize that this inner conflict is a sign of pushing my boundaries, a signal that I'm
seeking growth and refusing to settle for mediocrity. Now, don't get me wrong; I'm not here to call
anyone mediocre. I genuinely believe that great innovations and revolutionary products emerge from
restless minds. It's time for me to push myself to search for that elusive "click", to elevate my
game and become the most creative and passionate version of myself I've been in these past years.

# Pursuing my passion

I've always been the kind of person who thrives on challenges. Whether it's diving into a complex
coding problem or conquering a new video game, I find myself naturally drawn to the thrill of
mastering something, no matter how daunting it may seem.

Lately, I've been grappling with questions like, "What truly motivates me? What's the next big
challenge that will set my heart racing and rekindle my passion?" To be honest, I don't have all the
answers. However, as a committed engineer, I've been taking a systematic approach to uncovering
them.

One valuable resource I've been exploring is the book
[Designing Your Life](https://designingyour.life/the-book/). In this book, the authors, who also
happen to be experts on the subject at Stanford University, apply design thinking principles to the
realm of life and career. While the book primarily focuses on designing a fulfilling job, its
principles can be applied to various aspects of our lives. In the pages of "Designing Your Life", I
have been guided through a process of setting expectations and iterating on my life's path. It's a
fascinating approach that has helped me gain clarity on what I'm truly passionate about and how I
can align my career choices with those passions.
