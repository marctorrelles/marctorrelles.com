Have you ever felt the itch for change, the yearning for something new and daring, even when you're
comfortably settled in a familiar routine? For the past decade, I've been immersed in the world of
coding, a journey that began in my university days with humble C code and led me to my current role
as a Staff Engineer at [Factorial](https://factorialhr.com). While this path has provided financial
security and professional growth, a sense of restlessness has crept in recently, compelling me to
embark on a new, more exhilarating adventuree.

# The Comfort Zone

Coding has been my bread and butter for the past years. I started as a junior developer in a small
company, and over time, I've steadily climbed the ranks, acquiring not only technical skills but
also invaluable insights into phenomena like impostor syndrome and the fear of deploying new code.
Yet, this journey has been more than just mastering the intricacies of programming. It's been about
growth, mentorship, and the bonds forged through collaboration.

As I reflect on my path, I've come to realize that the true magic of this world lies not only in the
lines of code but also in the camaraderie and collective problem-solving with my colleagues. It's in
the infinite pairing sessions and the shared victories and setbacks that I've grown to cherish. In
the context of my comfort zone, it's not just about the familiarity of coding; it's about the
profound connections and collaborative spirit that have defined my journey.

Leaving a job that you've poured time and energy into is never a decision to be taken lightly. It's
like stepping into the unknown, uncertain about where your next opportunity will lead you. But
sometimes, that leap of faith is precisely what's needed to reignite the dormant passion within.

# The Pursuit of Passion

I've always been the kind of person who thrives on challenges. Whether it's diving into a complex
coding problem or conquering a new video game, I find myself naturally drawn to the thrill of
mastering something, no matter how daunting it may seem.

Lately, I've been grappling with questions like, "What truly motivates me? What's the next big
challenge that will set my heart racing and rekindle my passion?" To be honest, I don't have all the
answers. However, as a committed engineer, I've been taking a systematic approach to uncovering
them.

One valuable resource I've been exploring is the book
[Designing Your Life](https://designingyour.life/the-book/). In this book, the authors, who also
happen to be experts on the subject at Stanford University, apply design thinking principles to the
realm of life and career. While the book primarily focuses on designing a fulfilling job, its
principles can be applied to various aspects of our lives. In the pages of "Designing Your Life," I
have been guided through a process of setting expectations and iterating on my life's path. It's a
fascinating approach that has helped me gain clarity on what I'm truly passionate about and how I
can align my career choices with those passions.

# The Vertigo of Uncertainty

As I stand on the edge of this career precipice, I can't help but feel the vertigo creeping in.
It's that dizzying sensation of not knowing what's around the corner. Will the next opportunity be
as fulfilling as the last? Will I find a project that truly resonates with my values and
aspirations?

It's a whirlwind of emotions, a rollercoaster of self-doubt and excitement. But one thing I've
learned in my career is that sometimes, you need to embrace the vertigo. It's a sign that you're
pushing your boundaries, seeking growth, and refusing to settle for mediocrity.

# The Beauty of the Unknown

In the end, the vertigo is a reminder that life is an ever-evolving journey. Just like when I'm
coding and meticulously fine-tuning every detail, I need to approach my career with the same
dedication. The unknown isn't something to be feared; it's an opportunity waiting to be seized.

So, if you find yourself on the edge of your own career precipice, don't be afraid to step off and
embrace the vertigo. It's in those moments of uncertainty that you discover your true potential,
your passions, and the path that leads to your greatest achievements.
