      I'm Marc, a software engineer based in Barcelona. I've been working in software for
      the last 8 years, when I developed my passion and my job: coding 👨‍💻

      If I'm not pressing keys, you will find me reading, playing videogames, running or
      having a beer (ehmmm... okay, most of the times it's having a beer).
      I love to be challenged and face new problems, and also learn while solving those.
      I also like to get things perfectly done, so most of the times I spend some extra
      time in the little details 🌱
