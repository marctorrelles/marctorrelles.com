      If I'm not pressing keys, you will find me reading, playing videogames,
      running or just hanging out with my friendsâ€”probably, with a beer at my
      hand. I love to be challenged and face new problems, and also learn while
      solving those. I also like to get things perfectly done, so most of the
      times I spend some extra time in the little details.

      comes my way. Check it out!
