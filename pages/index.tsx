      If I'm not pressing keys, you will find me listening to music, reading,
      playing videogames, running or just hanging out with my friends. I love to
      be challenged and face new problems, and also learn while solving those. I
      also like to get things perfectly done, so most of the times I spend some
      extra time in the little details.

      I'm always excited about new projects and collaborations! So don't
      hesitate to contact me if you think we can make a good team.
